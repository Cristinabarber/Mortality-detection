# Mortality-detection
This code presents a multi-method occupancy model that accounts for measurement error in tree presence and absence from aerial imagery. The "Bestmodel_Int_twolevelsofdetection.stan" presents Stan code used to analyze data on tree mortality in a Panamanian landscape. The "Data_simulationCBJC_pqinter.R" file simulates comparable data to test model performance. The "Mortalitylogisticsimp.stan" and "SimulationTwoLevelsDetectionCBJCTC_Intercepts.stan" files analyze the simulated data using a model structure that is similar (but simplified) to the model used for real data.
